# Grab-List-of-Companies
Steps I took to grab and filter a large list of companies for potentially cold calling.

Step 1: Google list of companies in your area

This ^^^^^^^^ is an example of a site I quickly found using google.

It's definately a long list of about 50-60 which has descriptions, logos, etc. Which is great for the site and looks nice, but is horrible for compiling a list across multiple sites without having to type out(copy and paste) each and every one. And just copy-pasting the full page is going to give you a bunch of extra words you don't want. 

Step 2: Find the info you do want
